<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Last stage was wild, wasn't it? What a great party, it's a shame I don't really remember anything. Your app doesn't remember anything either: all playlists saved during our awesome party are now gone. You should change that now, implementing a database to keep the playlists saved.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Database:
	<ul>
		<li>you can make the design of this database very simple: it will be one table only, and you will only keep the relations between <code>playlistName</code> and <code>songId</code>;</li>
		<li>name the database <code>musicPlayerDatabase.db</code>;</li>
		<li>create a table with the name <code>playlist</code> if that table doesn't exist yet;</li>
		<li>add a <code>playlistName</code> column with the type <code>TEXT</code>;</li>
		<li>add a <code>songId</code> column with the type <code>INTEGER</code>;</li>
		<li>don't add the "All Songs" playlist to the database: this one should be kept in memory only;</li>
		<li>pairs of <code>playlistName</code> and <code>songId</code> should be unique, that is, don't add the same song to one playlist twice;</li>
		<li>if a playlist with the same name as an existing one is added, remove the old playlist and keep only the songs from the new playlist;</li>
		<li>if a playlist is loaded with an empty or non-existing "All Songs" playlist, then the search should be done automatically before loading the list; that is, first try loading the songs from the device into "All Songs" playlist once, then proceed with loading the playlist as usual;</li>
		<li>if a song from the saved playlist is not in the "All Songs" playlist, don't display it;</li>
		<li>removing a playlist does the obvious: remove all entries with that <code>playlistName</code>;</li>
		<li>if you are testing your app with an emulated device, you can find the database file on <code>data/data/org.hyperskill.musicplayer/databases</code> in the device file explorer; if you want to reset the database, you can just erase the database files; if you want to open the file to see the contents, you can do that by first clicking twice on the <code>musicPlayerDatabase.db</code>; </li>
		<li>if, when opening a file, its name has unreadable chars, right click on it and look for "open in terminal" – now you can use SQLite to open it with <code>sqlite3 ./musicPlayerDatabase.db</code>; you should have sqlite3 installed and reachable on <code>$PATH</code> to be able to do that.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><code>mainMenuLoadPlaylist</code>:
	<ul>
		<li>display the "All Songs" playlist even if the <code>mainSearchButton</code> hasn't been clicked yet;</li>
		<li>if any playlist is loaded before <code>mainSearchButton</code> is clicked, then the search should be done automatically before loading the list.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>obs: tests assume the existence of a file named "wisdom.mp3" on res/raw. It should be loaded automatically with the project, but if for some reason it goes missing use this link to restore it <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/791917/wisdom.mp3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/791917/wisdom.mp3</a></p>
